## 🚀 Getting Started

The platform is **80% complete** and fully functional for:
- User management
- Contest registration
- Backend evaluation
- Leaderboard tracking

To use it:
1. Follow SETUP.md for installation
2. Create admin user in MongoDB
3. Use API directly or build remaining UI components
4. Admin can create contests via API calls

## 📚 Documentation

- **SETUP.md** - Complete setup instructions
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Quick start commands
- **README.md** - Project overview
- **API Endpoints** - Available in code comments

## 🎨 Design System

Your platform uses:
- **Primary Color**: #FF6B35 (Orange)
- **Background**: Dark theme (950-900 shades)
- **Components**: Pre-built with Tailwind
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Font**: Inter (sans), Fira Code (mono)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test Backend First**: Use Postman/Thunder Client
2. **Create Admin**: Manually in MongoDB
3. **Judge0**: Optional, contests work without it
4. **Build Incrementally**: Add features one at a time
